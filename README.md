# Kitty-in-the-Rain

Kitty in the Rain is the first game dev project that I've built outside of school work.

Kitty in the Rain is a 2D Auto Side-Scroller game where you are a cute kitten getting back home as fast as you can while
trying to collect as much fish as possible. 

To play the game, download the "Kitty in the Rain.exe" application at the root of the repository, and then open the application.

The controls for the game are as follows.
Spacebar = Jump
Down Arrow Key = Fast fall
Enter = Pause

Feel free to contact me, Samer Elkhalid, if you would like to work on a video game project with me. I would truly appreciate it.
